An interactive web based demonstration of the Lorenz chaotic attractor.

You need to install the flot jquery graphing plugin under 'flot' for this code to work. See: http://www.flotcharts.org/ .

Having done this, you just need to copy to a directory inside your web root, and set the file permissions right for your system.
